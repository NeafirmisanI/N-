# Sets the variable "x" and "y" as 4 - "var" always goes before a variable, so that N# can recognize that it's a variable rather than an unknown #
# function or self-defined function. #
var x = "4"
var y = "4"
# Adds the variables "x" and "y" together. 
var z = y + x
# Prints the variable "z" to display output.
